# Why hello there! 🧑🏻‍🌾 🌱 🐜

You've stumbled across a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) tended by [Ben Newman](https://benjamn.com).

First, [[This garden is not a blog]]. It's more like a personal wiki, filled with twisty little passages, hosted as static HTML, CSS, JS, images, and sundry hypermedia,[^jekyll] using the fast and free global hosting provided by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).[^netlify]

[^jekyll]: The static site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),[^debt] which runs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions) whenever I push to [`main`](https://github.com/benjamn/garden/tree/main), where it has access to a private submodule repository containing drafts of notes visible only to me.

[^netlify]: You can easily deploy the site to Netlify instead of GitHub pages (see [`netlify.toml`](https://github.com/benjamn/garden/blob/main/netlify.toml)), also free.

[^debt]: I owe a debt to [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com) for publishing an aesthetically clean and simple Jekyll-based digital garden template [on GitHub](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), and for [this tutorial explaining how to set it up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

If you want your own immortal[^immortal] plot of internet land, head over to [[Forking this garden]].

[^immortal]: The only part I pay for is the $12/year vanity of registering [`benjamn.dev`](https://benjamn.dev) as a custom domain name for this garden, instead of using [`benjamn.github.io/garden`](https://benjamn.github.io/garden) for free.

See [[Markdown menagerie]] for examples of text formatting, linking, footnotes, and various supported plugins and media formats.

Incomplete list of remaining improvements I want to make: [[TODO]]
