## A note about GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages only partially supports this template: to power the interactive notes graph, this template uses a custom Jekyll plugin to generate the graph data in [`notes_graph.json`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/7ac331a4113bac77c993856562acc2bfbde9f2f7/_plugins/bidirectional_links_generator.rb#L102), and [GitHub Pages doesn't support custom Jekyll plugins](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins).

If you want to use the graph with GitHub Pages, you may try building your garden locally using Jekyll then pushing the result to GitHub Pages.

Alternatively, you may deploy your garden to Netlify and it'll work out of the box. [I wrote a guide explaining how to set this up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

If you don't care about the graph, you can simply remove it from this layout, [as explained here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/discussions/132#discussioncomment-3625772).
