title: This garden is not a blog
---

In the history of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), this one is both brand new and nothing new.

This garden is intended to become a deeply interlinked topology of evergreen notes, gathering meaningful connections between stable ideas, rejecting the doctrines of recency and reverse chronology that have gripped the internet ever since [_web logging_](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) became popular in the early 2000s.[^blame-social]

[^blame-social]: Blogs and bloggers were never the problem, of course. Google Reader was a fine blog aggregator, in its heyday. What went wrong? Social media companies co-opted the chronological form of blogs into a new kind of feeding lane, the news feed, increasingly filtered by algorithms and infested with targeted ads.

This digital garden displays timestamps indicating when notes were last updated, but there is no feed of latest updates.
